Prerequisites for running the program:-

Python 3
OpenCV 3
MongoDB (only for storing the results in database).
Tensorflow
Python 3 libraries for ML algorithms

*I would recommend using Anaconda Package Manager which already comes required libraries except OpenCV,TensorFlow and Pymongo


Open the Main Program folder and run "Start.py" file in tensorflow environment.
car6.mp4 video is present as a sample to test the program.

To run the code on a single car image,
goto "Main.py" file, uncomment last line main('OS269DT.jpg') and only execute this file.
